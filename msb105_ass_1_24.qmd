## Literature review

What is reproducibility?

In computational fields, reproducibility typically refers to the ability to reproduce computational results, focusing specifically on sharing and properly documenting data and code [@peng2011].

When people refer to a "replication," they may mean one of the following: duplicating the methods, procedures, and analysis of a study (regardless of the outcomes) or duplicating the methods, procedures, analysis, and the results themselves [@fidler2021].
These meanings describes two of the three parts that make up Research reproducibility.
The former describes Methods reproducibility, while the latter describes Results reproducibility.
Robustness and generalizability is the final part and takes account for the difference of outside effects on the experimental framework's setting [@goodman2016].
Methods reproducibility is referred to as Reproducibility and Results reproducibility is referred to as Replicability by the NSF [@bollen2015].

## Discussion of the reseach question with some catching heading

### How can Quarto documents help with reproducibility?

### What problems remains and how can these be solved?

-   Package version
-   R version, library versions
